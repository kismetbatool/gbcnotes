## Week 1 - History
- multiple writing systems were used: cave-drawing->cuneiform
- Printing systems: cylinder seals -> Gutenberg press
- Evolution of the alphabet: Phoenecian-> Independent systems (Chinese, Mesopotamia)
## Week 2 - Bits and Bytes
- Binary System: Bit- 0 or 1 Byte - a group of 8 Binary systems- represented by base 2
- Volatile: loses data when power is off (RAM)
- Non-volatile:  retains data without power (SSD, HDD)
- Number Representation: Unsigned Numbers: 0-255 for 8 bits Signed Numbers: -128 to 127 for 8 bits Fractional Numbers: scientific notation with two integers
- ASCII Table: Numbers -> characters
- Control Codes: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline)
- Number systems: Decimal (base 10) Binary (Base 2) Hexadecimal (Base 16)
- RAM: Volatile memory for active processes, SSD and HDD are used for long-term
## Week 3 - Text Structure
- Markdown syntax:

Titles: # Title, 

Italic: _ italic _

Bold: ** bold **

Lists: * item or - item

\# to display #
- HTML: Tags: < ul>, < li>, < p>, < strong>, < h1>, < h2>, < h3>

 & lt; for <, & gt; for >, & amp; for &

JSON:

Format: {"key": "value"}, human-readable

XML: Data use Tags: <tag > value </tag >

Unicode: > SCII more numbers and letters, Unicode codepoints, UTF-32=4 bytes to store, UTF-8= multiple bytes for /127. *popular*

Unicode codepoints: written as a hex point with a prefix of U+ ex U+21AA for the turning emoji

## Week 4 - Keyboards and Editors
Text Editors: Word Processors: Microsoft Word VS Text Editors (Notepad)

Popular Editors: Vim: Command-line based requires learning commands, eg exit command : q!

Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Popular, extensions and themes available. 

IDEs: Integrated development environments like WebStorm, and Pycharm. 

Searches: Basic: Cmd + f advanced: * for character seqeunce line\d+ to find line

## Week 5 - Command Line Interfaces
- History and Evolution: Teletype machine -> computers paper ->screens shortened commands because of convenience 
- Modern CLI Usage: The command line interface creates easier automation through scripting and minimal resource usage on computers. It is best for remote work with low bandwidth requirements.
- Basic commands:

 ls: List files in a directory.
 
cd: Change directory.

pwd: Print working directory.

cat: Display file contents.

less: View file contents interactively.

cp: Copy files.

mv: Move files.

mkdir: Create a directory.

ping: Test network connectivity.

grep: Search text using patterns.

- Remote Access and Security:
  SSH (Secure Shell)- connect to remote computers securely, command line access to remote systems.
  
  File Transfer: scp: Securely copy files between computers.
  
sftp: Secure file transfer protocol.

-Tools: htop: Monitor system processes and resource usage.

tmux: A terminal multiplexer for managing multiple sessions.


Linux (WSL) 
-Linux within Windows, using Linux tools alongside Windows application

## Week 6 - Git, Github, Diff, and Versioning
- Git: Open source tool to manage files. Linus Torvalds in 2005.
  
  Clone: Add a remote repository to your local machine.
  
  Pull: See the changes from the remote repository
  
  Modify: Edit files locally

  Commit: Save changes (-m )

  Push: Upload changes
  
- Github: Cloud service for git repository, has web-based editing and is owned by Microsoft
- Diff and Patch:
  
  Diff tool: Compares files to find differences.
  
  Patch files Describe changes to files
  
- Git in VS Code

  Source Control Pane: See changes, commit history, and manage braches

  Staging Area: select specifics

  Sync: both push and pull operations
  
- Branching:
  Purpose: Managing multiple lines of work
  
  Main Branch: Most stable

  Creating Branches: Can work on parallel development without changing the main line
  
- Conflicts
  Merge: Happens with changes overlap

   Resolution: Needs manual intervention to merge changes
